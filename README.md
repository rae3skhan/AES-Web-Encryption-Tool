## Description

This project provides a simple web application for encrypting and decrypting text using AES encryption, leveraging the CryptoJS library. It's designed to demonstrate the basics of encryption and decryption for educational purposes or for anyone interested in implementing basic security measures in their web applications.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Convert plaintext into ciphertext using AES encryption.
- **Decryption**: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy operation.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling encryption, decryption, and user interactions.
- `README.md`: Documentation detailing the code and functions.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter plaintext in the provided input field and click "Encrypt" to get the ciphertext.
3. Enter ciphertext in the provided input field and click "Decrypt" to get the plaintext.

## Encryption and Decryption

The AES encryption and decryption are implemented using the CryptoJS library. This ensures a high level of security for the encrypted data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply clone or download this repository and open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the application.
